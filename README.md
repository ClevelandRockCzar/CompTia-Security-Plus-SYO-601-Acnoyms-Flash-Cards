CompTia Security+ SYO-601 Anki Flash Card Deck. 
This is a Anki flash card deck for all of the acronyms used in the CompTia Security+ SYO-601 exam.
You must have Anki installed for it to work.
You can download the free desktop version here: https://apps.ankiweb.net/.
You have to pay for the mobile version but I beleive it's worth it.
For all of the definitions in the deck I found the best ones by searching the web and pasting them to my deck.
If you have a better or shorter definition for any of them please make a commit. Thanks!
